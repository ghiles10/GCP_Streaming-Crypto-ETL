# Send Data to producer

The data is extracted in real-time and sent to a Kafka producer using Python.

The folder is organized into modules using object-oriented programming. The final script is `send_kafka.py`, which creates a topic, a Kafka producer and sends the data in real-time.

``` ini
git clone https://github.com/ghiles10/GCP_Streaming-Crypto-ET.git && \
cd extract
```

- Start extracting : 

```ini 
python3 send_kafka.py
```
